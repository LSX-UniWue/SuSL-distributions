# Modeling Different Feature Distributions in Semi-Unsupervised Learning

## Datasets
We assume that the original datasets have been downloaded from their source:
```
/datasets_raw -> Original source files
/datasets_processed -> Files used in the repo -> Use /datasets/create_folds.py to create them.
```

## Notes
The submodule `susl_base` is from our repository [Semi-unsupervised Learning: An In-depth Parameter Analysis](https://github.com/LSX-UniWue/SuSL-in-depth).
